We meticulously rebuilt the game from the ground up in Unity, leveraging its robust engine capabilities and tools. This project involved translating and optimizing the game's mechanics, graphics, and user experience to fit the new engine, demonstrating our adaptability, problem-solving skills, and deep understanding of both game development platforms.

                            I am currently working on a solo game project with a goal to complete and publish it on Steam by the end of my first semester in my final year of college. The game is a 2D platformer where players control a cowboy with a mechanical arm, using a grappling mechanic to climb to the top of challenging levels. This project showcases my skills in game design, programming, and mechanics development, and serves as a capstone to my academic journey in game development.
